# Caesar Cipher in Ruby
Ruby implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a simple and effective encryption tool.

## Repository Description
This repository contains a Ruby program that implements the Caesar Cipher, a type of substitution cipher in which each character in the plaintext is ‘shifted’ a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, ‘A’ would be replaced by ‘B’, ‘B’ would become ‘C’, etc. The cipher is named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it to communicate with his generals.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone.
2. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal.
3. Run the program with the command ruby caesar_cipher.rb.
4. When prompted, enter the text you wish to encrypt and the number of positions you wish to shift.
